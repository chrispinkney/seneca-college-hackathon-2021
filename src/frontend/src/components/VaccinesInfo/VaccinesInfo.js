        General Vaccine Information How They Work Help lower risk of infection by working with the
        body’s natural defenses to develop protection against a disease -Vaccines are mainly made up
        of antigens which are: -not alive and contain killed (inactivated) germs OR -are alive but
        contain weakened (attenuated) germs -The body’s immune system uses antigens to create
        antibodies and immune memory. This helps the immune system destroy germ threats before they
        become dangerous, which helps prevent or lessen the impact of diseases How They Are Given
        -Most vaccines are given by needle into the upper arm or thigh -Some are given by mouth
        -There is one influenza vaccine that is sprayed into the nose for children -Some vaccines
        protect against multiple diseases in one shot, as a body’s immune system can safely learn
        from more than one vaccine at a time Vaccine Effectiveness -Most childhood vaccines provide
        over 90% protection -Some people may only develop partial protection following a
        vaccination, this may be due to: -age of the person -overall health status -person’s immune
        response -degree match between the vaccine and type of bacteria or virus circulating -In
        rare cases, people who have partial immunity can get the disease, but the vaccine helps with
        prevention of severe illness and serious outcome, including death -The more people who are
        vaccinated in a community, the lower the risk for those who have partial immunity or those
        who have not gotten the vaccine, this is call community or herd immunity -Community immunity
        helps those are high risk, such as: -infants and children too young to be fully vaccinated
        -adults age 65+ -people with health condition affecting their immune system who cannot get
        vaccines Vaccine Side Effects -Like any medication, vaccines can cause side effects and
        reactions -After being vaccinated, it is common to have temporary side effects which can
        last from a few hours to a few weeks -This is the body’s natural “inflammatory response”, as
        it is building immunity against the disease -Common side effects may include: -Mild fever
        -Flu-like symptoms, such as: -chills -fatigue -joint pain -headache -muscle aches -Redness,
        soreness, or swelling where the vaccine was given -Children being more fussy than usual -You
        can take medication to help with any pain or fever. Simply ask your health care provider for
        recommendations Rare Reactions -There is a small chance of anaphylaxis reactions to vaccines
        -Only happens to approximately 1 person in every 1 million people -Will happen shortly after
        the person receives the vaccine -Health care providers will ask patients to stay in the
        clinic for at least 15 minutes after the vaccine to monitor for this -Should it occur, the
        health care provider will deal with it quickly and report it to the public health department
        Vaccines Don’t Cause Autism -Researchers and scientists around the world have proven there
        is NO link between vaccines and autism -This rumor started when The Lancet (a British
        medical journal) published a study in 1998 by doctor Andrew Wakefield, claiming that the
        measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) vaccine caused autism -Since then, many larger studies have
        explored the same topic and have proven that there is no difference in the rate of autism
        between people with and people without vaccines. The article was also retracted by The
        Lancet Vaccine Safety -Vaccines must be tested several times to ensure they are safe for use
        before being approved in Canada. They undergo regulation checks by: -Health Canada -The
        Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) -Provincial / Territorial Health Authorities -The
        National Advisory Committee on Immunization -After vaccines are approved, they are regularly
        checked for safety and effectiveness by: -Nurses -Doctors -Pharmacists -Pharmaceutical
        companies who make them -Provincial / Territorial Health Authorities -Health Canada
        scientists -Public Health Agency of Canada
